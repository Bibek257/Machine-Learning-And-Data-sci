# 🎓 Student Performance Prediction – Machine Learning Regression Project

This project predicts students’ final academic performance (G3 grade) using various features such as study time, support systems, prior grades, and family 
background. The goal is to develop and compare multiple regression models that can help identify factors contributing to academic outcomes.



## 📁 Dataset Overview

- Source: UCI Student Performance Dataset
- File: student-mat.csv
- Each row = one student

## 🧼 Data Preprocessing

- Removed irrelevant and duplicate columns
- Encoded categorical/binary features
- Handled outliers and checked for skewness
- Standardized numeric features with StandardScaler
- Split into training and testing sets (80/20)

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Correlation heatmap
- Distribution of final grade (G3)
- Pairplots to explore numeric relationships
- Boxplots to visualize impact of features like support or failures

## 🤖 Machine Learning Models Used

| Model Type               | Description                                         |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Linear Regression        | Baseline model for linear relationships             |
| Ridge Regression (L2)    | Regularized linear model to reduce overfitting      |
| Lasso Regression (L1)    | L1 penalty to reduce and select features            |
| Decision Tree Regressor  | Captures non-linear splits                          |
| K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)| Distance-based model using nearest neighbors        |
| Support Vector Regressor | Uses kernel-based optimization for margin fitting   |

✅ All models were evaluated using:
- R² Score
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

## 📈 Results & Insights

- G1 and G2 (previous grades) are highly predictive of final G3 grade.
- Support systems (school/family), study time, and failures also affect performance.
- SVR and Ridge performed consistently well after scaling.
- KNN performed best when tuned with an optimal k value.
