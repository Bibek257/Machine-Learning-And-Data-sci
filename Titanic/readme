🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction – Machine Learning Project
This project uses machine learning to predict survival outcomes for passengers aboard the Titanic based on features like age, sex, class, fare, etc.

🧠 Project Objective
Predict whether a passenger survived (binary classification)

Use preprocessing, feature selection, and regularization techniques

Compare performance of multiple models (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest)

📂 Dataset
Source: Kaggle Titanic Dataset

Target variable: Survived (0 = No, 1 = Yes)

🔍 Features Used
Pclass

Sex (encoded)

Age (filled with mean)

Fare

SibSp, Parch

Embarked (encoded)

Engineered features like Title (optional)

🧼 Preprocessing Steps
Handled missing values (Age, Embarked, Cabin)

Label encoded categorical features

Feature selection using Chi-Square

Correlation heatmap (used during analysis)

⚙️ Models Trained
Logistic Regression (with L1 & L2 regularization)

Decision Tree Classifier (tuned with max_depth, criterion, etc.)

Random Forest Classifier (tuned with max_features, class_weight, etc.)

📈 Evaluation Metrics
